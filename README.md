# Summer 2025 Outreach

## About
Summer 2025 Outreach is a collection of materials, plans, and documentation for organizing and running a summer outreach program during the summer of 2025. This repository includes schedules, presentation slides, promotional content, and relevant communication templates aimed at engaging the community and expanding the program.

## Summer Plan

### Initial Stage
- Students will gain hands-on experience with Python installation and usage, as well as foundational skills in Git, GitHub, and cloud server environments.  
- Students will begin by going through the notebooks in my repository: [Summer2025Outreach Notebooks](https://github.com/oxu2/Summer2025Outreach).  
- The code, created by our labmate Ruiyu Mao, is a simplified version of the Dive into Deep Learning project ([d2l.ai](https://d2l.ai/)). It provides students with a low‐overhead way to become familiar with Python and standard deep learning models.

### Final Project

The final project will serve as a practical component where students apply what they have learned in the outreach program. Below is an overview:

- We may explore the paper **“SafeFix: Targeted Model Repair via Controlled Image Generation”**, which represents an active research direction in our lab and is a project I am primarily responsible for.
- To reduce overhead, we may shrink the dataset and/or use Google Colab so that models can be trained efficiently.
- The goal is to help students understand the **machine learning project pipeline**, and to explore **data-efficient methods** in practical scenarios.
- The project will involve components from:
  - **Computer vision models**
  - **Text-to-image generative models**
  - **Large vision-language models (VLMs)**
  
These topics align closely with current trends in AI research.
