# Summer 2025 Outreach

## About
Summer 2025 Outreach is a collection of materials, plans, and documentation for organizing and running a summer outreach program during the summer of 2025. This repository includes schedules, presentation slides, promotional content, and relevant communication templates aimed at engaging the community and expanding the program.

## Summer Plan

### Initial Stage
- Students will gain hands-on experience with Python installation and usage, as well as foundational skills in Git, GitHub, and cloud server environments.  
- Students will begin by going through the notebooks in my repository: [Summer2025Outreach Notebooks](https://github.com/oxu2/Summer2025Outreach).  
- The code, created by our labmate Ruiyu Mao, is a simplified version of the Dive into Deep Learning project ([d2l.ai](https://d2l.ai/)). It provides students with a low‐overhead way to become familiar with Python and standard deep learning models.

### Final Project
- We may explore the paper “SafeFix: Targeted Model Repair via Controlled Image Generation,” which is an active research direction in our lab that I am primarily responsible for.  
- We may shrink the dataset and/or use Google Colab so it trains faster. The plan is to help students understand the core components of the machine learning project pipeline and explore more data-efficient methods.  
- The project integrates computer vision models, text-to-image generative models, and large vision-language models, which are highly popular in current AI research.
